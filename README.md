## IMPORTANT
This app is a hobby project, so it can't the accepted by Spotify. To use the site, use your own client ID on your fork and host it yourself (for example on GH Pages). The website hosted on this repo is for my personal use only (because it only works like that)

# Statify

Spotify stats viewer made with love, Svelte and DaisyUI.
Very simple, practical project. All data is stored on-device.
